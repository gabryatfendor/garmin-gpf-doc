## Documentation for Garmin .gpf files created by trial and errors

### Intro
**Garmin eTrex 20** are shipped with the feature of create/edit profiles. You can do it "graphically" directly from the device, but in the end every choice related to a profile is saved into an XML file with a .gpf format. The aim of this project is to document every field inside these files (since I found no documentation about it online)

### Project structure
* doc folder contains all the documentation written about .gpf files and it's the core of the project. The shipped-profiles folder
* shipped-profiles folder contains all the .gpf files that were shipped with the eTrex 20x
* custom-profiles folder contains all the .gpf files created for experimentation

### DISCLAIMER
All the testing has been done on a **Garmin eTrex 20**. I don't really know if the same settings are applicable to other Garmin devices
